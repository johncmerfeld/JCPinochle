# JCPinochle

## Mission
Create a pinochle web application (`Game`) that can be played between one human (`CarbonPlayer`) and two AI bots (`SiliconPlayers`)

## Development log

### Tuesday, August 21st, 2018:
As I see it currently, there are three top-level modules to this project:
  - A **web interface** between the `CarbonPlayer` and the `Game`
  - A **game backend** that stores information about the `Game` and interfaces with the `CarbonPlayer` and `SiliconPlayers`
  - A **Pinchole AI** that can respond to `Game` information and make decisions for the `SiliconPlayers`

All three modules have second-tier components.

**Web Interface**
